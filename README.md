# Online Table Top Simulator
This application is a basic table top simulator that can be used for playing any kind of game that would require a table top, i.e. board games or pen and paper games. It consists of a basic login, a game viewer, and the actual online table top game board that will be used for the playing of the game. The board will have a basic grid that allows the user to add tokens or game backgrounds to use for their game. Tokens will be able to be dragged and dropped into different cells of the grid. There will be a basic dice roller that allows users to get a randomly generated value from clicking on the dice roller.
